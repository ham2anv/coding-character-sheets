    <h1>A First Look at HTML</h1>
    <p>
        This document shows you just a little bit of what HTML looks like. For
        a much more comprehensive reference (to HTML and other web
        technologies), I use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
        Mozilla Developer Network</a>.

    <p>Anyway, here's a picture of a kitten.</p>
