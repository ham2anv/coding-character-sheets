    <p>This paragraph has no particular styles applied to it beyond the default for your browser. On this page, anything in <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> should be <code>crimson</code>.</p>
    <p class="sidebar">This paragraph has the class <code>sidebar</code>. It should have a black border around it and be indented on all sides. Its text is in <code id="gray-code">darkslategray</code>.</p>
    <p class="sidebar but-in-blue">This paragraph also has the <code>sidebar</code> class, but the text is blue because it also has the <code>but-in-blue</code> class, which comes later in the CSS.</p>
    <p class="sidebar" id="biggest">This <code>sidebar</code> should be the biggest. It's border should be green.</p>
