# coding-character-sheets

[Coding Character Sheets] is a collection of resources for game moderators,
game designers and publishers looking to use web technologies in presenting and
distributing their games.

My name is Paul Stefko, and I'm a tabletop game designer, developer, writer,
and consultant. I am not a web design or web technology professional. Rather,
I'm an enthusiastic amateur who has been studying and using these technologies
in my own game design publications for many years. 

This repo includes the original Markdown files for each post as well as any
example code or exercises we make along the way.
