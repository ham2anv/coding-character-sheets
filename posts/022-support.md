excerpt: A few ways you can help support the blog, so I can keep doing it.
---

I love doing this blog. When I started it a few months ago, it scratched two big
itches. First, it served as a test-bed for my own skills. And second, it gave me
a platform to do something I'd wanted to do for a long time: teach people how to
get their tabletop games online quickly and easily.

But you know what else I love? Feeding my family. Fixing my car when it breaks
down. Repairing the water leaks in my basement. We live in a system where doing
any of those things is very difficult, unless you are very lucky.

I had the time and energy to start this blog in the first place because I found
myself out of work. That situation has continued. I'm lucky in that I have not
hit a significant financial crisis yet, thanks to my wife's job and our savings.
But it's not exactly a great position to be in either way.

If you're reading this, and you've enjoyed or gotten value from what I do on
this blog, you can help me out. There are a number of ways to support what I do,
either once or on a continuing basis, and at any level you can comfortably
afford.

First, you can become a [GitHub Sponsor]. The GitHub Sponsor service supports
both one-time and monthly contributions, and I have a number of support tiers
available. For just $5 a month, you get a neat Sponsor badge on your GitHub
profile. Or for a $500 one-time donation, I will run an online session of your
favorite RPG for you and your group.

Second, I have an ongoing [Patreon] where I send out monthly game zines and
other content. Recently, I gave my supporters an entire 13,000-word retroclone
RPG. You can become a supporter there for as little as $1 per month.

I'm also on [Ko-fi]. You can pitch in there with a one-time donation or monthly.
You can also buy some of my games there, through my Ko-fi shop.

And speaking of buying my games, I have all kinds of games up on DriveThruRPG
and itch.io. You can check out some of what I have to offer at my [Products]
page.

Thank you for reading this far. I really hope you get value out of what I do on
this blog. No matter what, everything here will always be free and available to
whoever needs it. If you can support that, I would really appreciate it.
