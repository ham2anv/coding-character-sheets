 grids dynamically and positioning items intentionally."

[Previously], we discussed the basics of the CSS Grid layout system. Let's
continue with some more advanced features.

## Dynamic Sizing
Rather than have to define a track's size either with absolute values _or_
fractional units `fr`, Grid provides the `minmax()` function to let you define
upper and lower limits for sizing. A track with `minmax(100px, 1fr)` will
always be at least 100 pixels, but it can be more if `1fr` is larger.

In addition to absolute lengths, percentages, and fractional units, `minmax()`
can take a few special keywords. `min-content` and `max-content` refer to the
minimum and maximum sizes of all items on the track based on their content. `auto` is more complicated, but it works similarly to those two in their
respective limits. 

It's also possible to have a dynamic number of tracks based on the size of the
container. This requires the `repeat()` function with the `auto-fill` or
`auto-fit` keyword for the number of repetitions. The difference between
`auto-fill` and `auto-fit` is that `auto-fill` will keep making empty tracks
based on sizing limits, while `auto-fit` will collapse any empty tracks. (If
you're not sure which is right for you, try both and see what changes.)

So, the following code...

```css
.grid-multi-col {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, 100px);
}
```

...will create as many 100-pixel column tracks as will fit in the available
space. If the container is 450 pixels wide, this means it will have four
columns. If you have fewer than four grid items, however, any empty tracks will
collapse.

You can combine this use of `repeat()` with `minmax()` to create a _dynamic
number_ of _dynamically sized_ tracks. The browser will add as many tracks of
the minimum size in `minmax()` as will fit in the grid container, then it will
let those tracks expand as much as possible to fill the remaining space, up to the maximum size in `minmax()`. So the following code...

```css
.grid-dynamic-col {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px,1fr));
}
```

...will create as many 200-pixel-wide column tracks as it can in the available
space, but once it can't fit any more, it will let the tracks it's made expand
until each one takes an equal share of the container. Resizing the container—
say by resizing the browser window—will change the number of columns _and_ the
width of each column. (To see this in action, check out [this example] from
Grid By Example by Rachel Andrew.)

## Positioning Items
In our last discussion, I mentioned that the browser has invisible, numbered
lines around each track. Those lines are useful when we want to directly
positition an item on the grid, rather than letting the browser do it
automatically. They also let us define grid items that span multiple columns
and/or rows.

These lines begin at 1 at the start of the first track in a given dimension.
The count goes up by 1 after each track, so the first column always starts at
line 1 and ends at line 2. The browser also lets you count backward from the
end of the final track by also numbering the lines with negative values in the
opposite direction. So the final column of a grid always starts with -2 and
ends with -1. (The same line always has two numbers, one positive and one
negative.)

You can give a grid item the `grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end`,
`grid-row-start`, and `grid-row-end` properties to define its exact location
on the grid. Each of these takes one of those line numbers as its value. You
can also use the `grid-column` and `grid-row` shorthand properties, seperating
the two values with a slash `/`. So, an item with `grid-column: 2 / 3` will
always be placed in the second column (between lines 2 and 3).

To make a grid item span multiple tracks, just make it end more than one line
after it starts. So, an item with `grid-row: 1 / 3` would span the first and
second rows, starting at line 1 and ending at line 3. If you want the item to
span the entire grid in a given direction, use `1 / -1` as the value.

But that's not all! CSS lets you _name_ areas of your grid for easier
reference. When you set up your `grid-template-columns` or `grid-template-rows`
properties, you can name grid lines by putting `[*-start]` and `[*-end]`
between your track sizes. Here's an example (with line breaks for readability):

```css
.grid-named-cols {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows:
      [header-start] 200px [header-end]
      1fr
      [footer-start] 150px [footer-end];
}
```

This creates three rows in our grid: a 200-pixel row, then a flexible row, and
finally a 150-pixel row. Lines 1 and 2 (the start and end of the first row)
have been renamed "header", while lines 3 and 4 (the start and end of the last
row) have been renamed "footer."

To place an item in a named area, you can use the `grid-column` and `grid-row`
properties, replacing numbers with the name. But a faster way is to use the
`grid-area` shorthand property. In our example above, I can give an item
`grid-area: header`, and it will be placed in the first row.

You can also give lines more than one name. Say we wanted to refer to the
middle row in our example as "content." We can just add `content-start` and
`content-end` into our code from before:

```css
.grid-named-cols {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows:
      [header-start] 200px
      [header-end content-start] 1fr
      [content-end footer-start] 150px [footer-end];
}
```

Named lines can span multiple tracks, and you can use the same names in both
`grid-template rows` and `grid-template-columns` to create areas that span both
rows _and_ columns. At that point, though, your areas are probably getting
complex enough that you'll want to use our final trick.

The `grid-template-areas` property lets you define arrangements of named areas
in a "text art" style. You define each row as a string surrounded by quotation
marks `"` and containing a name for each column in that row (without "-start"
or "-end"). The result names all of your areas at once. (If you don't need to
name a particular cell, you can put a period `.` to hold its place.) You can
even use as many spaces as you want to make everything line up nicely.

Here's a big example to show how all this works together (outlines added to
make areas more obvious):

```css
.grid-names {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr 1fr 100px;
    grid-template-rows: 2em 1fr 2em;
    grid-template-areas:
      "left left    right   right"
      ".    content content ."
      "foot foot    foot    foot";
}
.grid-names div {
    border: 1px solid gray;
}
.left {
    grid-area: left;
}
.right {
    grid-area: right;
    text-align: right;
}
.content {
    grid-area: content;
}
.foot {
    grid-area: foot;
    text-align: center;
}
```

```html
<div class="grid-names">
<div class="left">Left Header</div>
<div class="right">Right Header</div>
<div class="content">
  Sint cillum id fugiat est minim ut nulla ad
  proident adipisicing. Officia minim ad quis id ut
  ex ad amet deserunt velit duis exercitation.
  Dolore est fugiat consequat ex exercitation. Dolore
  consequat ipsum ex aute nisi. Qui dolore duis duis
  tempor reprehenderit pariatur dolore. Non labore
  eiusmod duis et duis anim. Dolore esse ad cupidatat
  nulla excepteur fugiat in nisi ut sit enim.
</div>
<div class="foot">Footer</div>
</div>
```

<style>
.grid-names {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr 1fr 100px;
    grid-template-rows: 2em 1fr 2em;
    grid-template-areas:
      "left left    right   right"
      ".    content content ."
      "foot foot    foot    foot";
}
.grid-names div {
    border: 1px solid gray;
}
.left {
    grid-area: left;
}
.right {
    grid-area: right;
    text-align: right;
}
.content {
    grid-area: content;
}
.foot {
    grid-area: foot;
    text-align: center;
}
</style>

<div class="grid-names">
<div class="left">Left Header</div>
<div class="right">Right Header</div>
<div class="content">
  Sint cillum id fugiat est minim ut nulla ad
  proident adipisicing. Officia minim ad quis id ut
  ex ad amet deserunt velit duis exercitation.
  Dolore est fugiat consequat ex exercitation. Dolore
  consequat ipsum ex aute nisi. Qui dolore duis duis
  tempor reprehenderit pariatur dolore. Non labore
  eiusmod duis et duis anim. Dolore esse ad cupidatat
  nulla excepteur fugiat in nisi ut sit enim.
</div>
<div class="foot">Footer</div>
</div>

## Conclusion
There's still more cool stuff we can do with CSS Grid, so we'll come back to it
again in the next post. Until then, play around with layouts, and see what you
can come up with!
